  bio1: "A family friendly Tech Guy who has been in the Industry for 25+ years. Carlos was born in Toronto and for a while he seemed a little Robotic. It all changed when he heard Super Freak on Tarzan Dan.  He loves groovy tunes but has a soft spot for Gigabytes & Doo-Hickeys.  He eventually found his way to Burlington with the loves of his life...  Ellie, Daisy, Tania and Adele.  ",
  bio2: "Carlos started programming his Commodore 64 back in the 80s and has been doing it ever since.  He opened a \"Friendly Neighbourhood Computer Shop\" in Etobicoke in 1998 and proudly provided amazing service there for 15 years. In 2013 he moved to Burlington and started Geek2go.ca to provide top-notch IT services for individuals and businesses in the area.  When he's not working, you can find him spending time with his family, playing video games, or exploring the latest tech trends.",
